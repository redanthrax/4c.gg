# API Integrations

This section contains PowerShell scripts and utilities for HaloPSA API interactions, automation, and third-party integrations. These solutions help streamline MSP workflows and extend HaloPSA functionality.

## Coming Soon

This section will include:

- **Automation Scripts** - Bulk operations and automated maintenance tasks
- **Data Synchronization** - Integration with external systems and tools
- **Reporting Automation** - Automated report generation and distribution
- **Workflow Enhancement** - Scripts to streamline common MSP workflows
- **Configuration Management** - Automated configuration and setup scripts
- **Third-Party Integrations** - Connections to monitoring tools, PSA systems, and more

## Prerequisites

Before using API integration scripts:

- **HaloPSA API Access** - Valid API credentials with appropriate permissions
- **PowerShell Environment** - PowerShell 5.1 or newer
- **Network Connectivity** - Reliable connection to HaloPSA API endpoints
- **Authentication Setup** - Proper OAuth 2.0 or API key configuration

## API Requirements

Scripts in this section will utilize:
