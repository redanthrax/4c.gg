# Azure Auth Portnox Radius Service with Duo Push

*Published on December 21, 2022*

This guide covers setting up Azure authentication integration with Portnox Radius service and Duo Push for enhanced network security and multi-factor authentication.

## Overview

Combining Azure Active Directory, Portnox RADIUS, and Duo Security creates a robust authentication system that provides:

- Centralized identity management through Azure AD
- Network access control via Portnox
- Multi-factor authentication with Duo Push notifications
- Seamless user experience across network resources

## Prerequisites

- Azure Active Directory tenant
- Portnox Cloud or on-premises deployment
- Duo Security account and application setup
- Network infrastructure supporting RADIUS authentication

## Architecture

The authentication flow involves:

1. User attempts network access
2. Network device queries Portnox RADIUS server
3. Portnox forwards authentication to Azure AD
4. Azure AD validates user credentials
5. Duo Push notification sent to user device
6. Upon approval, access is granted

## Configuration Steps

### Azure AD Setup

Configure Azure AD for RADIUS authentication:

- Create application registration
- Configure authentication protocols
- Set up user groups and permissions
- Enable conditional access policies

### Portnox Configuration

Set up Portnox to integrate with Azure AD:

- Configure LDAP/LDAPS connection to Azure AD
- Set up RADIUS server settings
- Create authentication policies
- Configure network device integration

### Duo Integration

Integrate Duo Security for MFA:

- Create Duo application
- Configure RADIUS proxy settings
- Set up push notification policies
- Test authentication flow

## Security Considerations

- Use secure communication protocols (LDAPS, encrypted RADIUS)
- Implement proper certificate validation
- Configure appropriate timeout values
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Regular security updates and patches

## Benefits

This integrated solution provides:

- **Enhanced Security**: Multi-layered authentication
- **Centralized Management**: Single identity source
- **User Experience**: Seamless authentication flow  
- **Compliance**: Audit trails and access logging
- **Scalability**: Cloud-based infrastructure

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- Certificate validation errors
- RADIUS timeout issues
- Azure AD connectivity problems
- Duo push notification failures
- Network device configuration issues

## Conclusion

Implementing Azure AD authentication with Portnox RADIUS and Duo Push creates a comprehensive security solution for network access control. This setup provides enterprise-grade security while maintaining user convenience through modern authentication methods.

The integration enables organizations to leverage existing Azure AD investments while adding robust network access control and multi-factor authentication capabilities.
