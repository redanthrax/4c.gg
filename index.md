# Welcome to 4c.gg

Hello! I'm a passionate developer sharing my thoughts, projects, and experiences in the world of technology.

## About Me

I'm a dedicated technology professional with a passion for cloud computing and infrastructure management. As a **Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate**, I specialize in implementing, managing, and monitoring Microsoft Azure environments.

With extensive experience in cloud architecture, automation, and DevOps practices, I help organizations optimize their Azure deployments for scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness. My expertise spans across virtual machines, storage solutions, networking, identity management, and governance within the Azure ecosystem.

Beyond Azure administration, I'm a full-stack developer with experience in modern web technologies, containerization, and infrastructure as code. I believe in continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the tech community through practical examples and real-world solutions.
